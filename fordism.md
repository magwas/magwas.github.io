# About Fordism

Yesterday I realized I am a Fordist. But not quite.

The main notion of Fordism is that we should use scientific methods to achieve mass production.
The three principles, as Wikipedia puts it:

1. The standardization of the product (nothing is handmade, but everything is made through machines and molds by unskilled workers)
2. The employment of assembly lines, which use special-purpose tools and/or equipment to allow unskilled workers to contribute to the finished product
3. Workers are paid higher "living" wages so that they can afford to purchase the products they make

My startup uses these principles to make coding as a profession available to the masses. Programmers hate it.

Our sin is that we offer good salaries for ordinary people, allowing them to work whenever they like, wherever they like.

They feel that one of [their principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) which
emphasize teams of individuals is broken by us. They worship individualism of programmers.
Programmers are superheros: understand the profession of their customers, know a lot about the art of designing programs,
can keep a lot of things in their head. Clearly the elite.

We do not consider individualism as they do: we deliberately made coding (which is quite, but not entirely different from programming)
into a profession where everything you do is between narrow boundaries. This makes it easier to practice, and makes probablility of mistakes
very low.

So far fordism look like a good idea. But the workers get better wages and better work conditions because it happens to be in the interest of
the investor. This is what we call capitalism.

And there is a serious problem with the current form of capitalism: it contains some processes which strengthen themselves. Such processes are
called positive feedback loops, and their consequence is a cataclismic change in the system. Phisics says that.

Some drawbacks of Fordism were forecasted in Brave New World by ALdous Huxley. Treating people like machines is not positive, even if they feel
good in the process. But it would be a tremendous waste of resources. People are creative, and by cooperation we can solve problems truly on
the global scale. We need this capability right now, because the results of the positive feedback loop are becoming obvious: climate change,
extremist and dumb world leaders, and all kind of suffering in the world; people die of hunger while we can produce enugh food for everyone,
people die in wars other countries cause - for oil or just to boost their own defence industry - in their home, or killed because
some politicians hope to gain votes by extremism.

"Inequalities" is a bad world for it: too euphemistic, and conveys the assumption that
those living well are necessarily evil. We are not. Some people do bad things, and if they have the means, they sometimes do very bad things.
But it is a minority of the people. We live in a so complex world, with a so complex set of motivations, that everyone is motivated
to keep up the system which generates the above problems: We drive our cars a lot unnecesarily, and buy things we do not need.

Some of the rich people even set goals to themselves which are aimed at handling the consequences, like greener world, saving humanity by
inhabiting Mars. One prominent of them is Elon Musk. He could also be called a Fordist. Remember the scenes from Breve New World when
they worship Ford? Their sign is a capital T for the Model T. Now take a look at the sign of Musk's cars. Of course that could wery well
be a mere coincidence.

If you take a look at the principles of Fordism, they can be rephrased in a more general way:

Principle &#35;1 is about efficiency. Efficiency means we achieve the best results with the least resources. And of course it is only possible
if we use the results of science. Which actually say that a process can only be made efficient if its measurable, and that implies that its deliverables are standardized.

The second principle is also about efficiency: we should be able to adapt to changes, making us more resilient against them.

The third principle is about valuing people. You could say that in fordism it is just an artifact of the greed of investors. And you are partly right. If the investor
is greedy, it will have the same result. But if you think about it, the best way to make sure that you and your descendants live a decent life is to make sure that
the world is a place where everyone can live a decent life.

So we can rephrase the principles more generally as:

1. Make everything more efficient using the results of science.
2. Adapt to changes, and build resiliency.
3. Value people.

So far so good, but you can ask: "How it will save us from the impending doom?"

Just apply the principles to it: Politics and the economy are a set of processes, and include (must include) all of the processes which can handle the feedback loops
threatening collapse of the civilisation. If we examine these processes, we realize that the communication structure, the motivational structure, and a lot of key processes
like the way we vote are plain contraproductive. Fortunately science today have all the means to analyze these processes and to come up solutions which result in
better decision-making from grassroots to the global level (a.k.a. politics), and economic solutions which dampen the positive feedback loops, makes possible for everyone
to live a decent live, and even keeps the free market, as it is one of the most important ways to value people through their achievements.
