My hobby is to think about big problems of humanity and try to find scientifically sound, working solutions to them.

You could say that it is futile. Those problems are not solved yet for a reason. I am so baselessly optimistic, that I can offer even two counter-arguments:

1. If we could shape the Earth without much cooperation so deeply that we depleted all major sources of fish on the oceans, killed out whole biomes and changine even the climate of the planet, maybe we could do things on the same scale which are actually beneficial for us as a species.
2. Maybe these problems are not solved yet because no one had both the means and the motivation to solve them. After all some of those problems became urgent only recently, and some of the ingredients of the solution (like game theory and biorefineries) are also quite recent.

[Enumerati](book/en) is about how could we cooperate for our collective benefit for a change.

[The raft](raft) is about sequestering meaningful amounts of carbon from the athmosphere, and provide habitat for those who have been dislocated due to our greed, manifesting in climate change and wars.
